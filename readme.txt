2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure that in the header.php file, is included on the line 63, the version 1.7.2 or higher of jQuery. In that line, the following code is what should be:
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js">

5. Add a new Slide for each image: In order to insert an image to the slider, that image must be uploaded on a post. Any text placed on the post will be the caption text and the tittle of the post (if any) will be the slide tittle.
6. The image uploaded must be set as a featured image for that post.
7. Also, the category created must be checked while creating the post.
8. Once created and published the posts with the featured images, go to the Slidershock control panel in the dashboard, and select the category you classified the images in from the categories dropdown menu.
